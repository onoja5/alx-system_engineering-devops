Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 16, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The main web application experienced intermittent downtime and severe performance degradation, affecting approximately 30% of users. Users were unable to access the service or experienced significant delays in loading pages.

Timeline:

- May 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC): The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in error rates and response times.

- The incident was escalated to the engineering team, and investigations began to identify the root cause of the problem.
- Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to the database, as recent changes were made to the database schema.
- Database logs and performance metrics were analyzed, but no significant issues were found.
- Network connectivity and load balancer configurations were investigated, but no abnormalities were discovered.
- The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further assistance in diagnosing the problem.
- May 15, 2023, 5:00 PM (UTC): The infrastructure team discovered an anomaly in the caching layer configuration and its interaction with the application servers.
- The misconfiguration caused cache misses, resulting in excessive requests to the backend systems and overwhelming the application servers.
- The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the caching layer and restarting the affected services.
- May 16, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC): The issue was fully resolved, and the web application returned to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the caching layer, leading to cache misses and increased load on the application servers. This resulted in degraded performance and intermittent downtime.

Resolution: 

The misconfiguration in the caching layer was identified and fixed by adjusting the cache settings and restarting the affected services. This allowed the cache to serve requests efficiently, reducing the load on the application servers and restoring normal operation.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be taken:

- Implement stricter configuration management processes to ensure changes in the caching layer are thoroughly reviewed and tested before deployment.
- Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect cache-related issues and abnormal caching behavior.
- Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to identify potential misconfigurations or performance bottlenecks.
- Improve incident response and escalation procedures to ensure effective collaboration between engineering and infrastructure teams during critical incidents.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Review and update caching layer configuration guidelines to include best practices and recommendations.
- Develop and implement automated tests to verify caching configurations and prevent misconfigurations.
- Enhance monitoring system to provide real-time visibility into cache hit rates, latency, and overall caching performance.
- Conduct a thorough review of the incident response process and update the escalation matrix to ensure timely involvement of the infrastructure team.
- Schedule regular cache configuration audits to identify and rectify potential issues proactively.
- By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to improve the stability and performance of our web stack, reducing the likelihood of similar incidents and minimizing their impact on our users and services.
